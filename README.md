# garminconnect_heatmaps
This repo contains the code that will download one's activity data from Garmin Connect as gpx files and then make a heatmap of the activities.  This will let you visualize your activity data to see how much of a location you have run, biked, or swam.  

I made this tool because I wanted to see how much of Atlanta I had run and have an easy way to update my progress.  All you need to make these heatmaps is a Garmin Connect (or Strava) account and a Google Maps API key.
